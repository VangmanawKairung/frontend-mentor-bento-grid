## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to handle more complex layouts that don’t fit into a simple grid structure. Since the design required sections that couldn’t be divided evenly, I had to use a nested grid approach by grouping elements together and then applying grid rules inside that group. This gave me more control and flexibility over the layout.

Another important lesson was about positioning and background handling. Initially, I used `position: absolute` for certain elements, but this caused issues with sizing and alignment across different screen sizes. By adjusting my approach and working with grid and background properties instead, I achieved a cleaner and more responsive design.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue improving my ability to create more adaptive layouts by practicing with additional breakpoints, such as tablet sizes, to make designs fully responsive across all devices. I also plan to refine my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox combinations, since many real-world layouts require using both together effectively.

Another area I would like to develop is accessibility and semantic HTML. Making sure that the structure and content are accessible to all users is an important step toward building professional-quality websites.

Lastly, I aim to explore adding interactive elements such as hover states, animations, or transitions. This will not only make the design more engaging but also help me gain more practical experience with dynamic user interactions.
